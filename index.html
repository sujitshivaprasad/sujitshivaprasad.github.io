	<h1>Hi there, I'm Sujit Shivaprasad!</h1>
	<p><img src="img/me.png" alt="Sujit Shivaprasad" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10"/>	
	I love everything science, engineering, technology and finance. 
	Originally from Oregon, I have lived in India, Texas and Indiana. 
	<br>
	<br>
	I am currently an engineer at Boeing, working on Aircraft Environmental Control Systems.
	<br>
	<br>
	Previously, I was a control systems engineer at Rolls Royce. In May 2017, I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Aeronautical & Astronautical Engineering from Purdue University.
	<br>
	<br>
	My primary technical interests include aerospace controls, modeling & simulation, systems and software engineering. 
	<br>
	<br>
	In my free time, I enjoy basketball, football, running, climbing, hiking, travel, spinning some records and tasting a new brew.
