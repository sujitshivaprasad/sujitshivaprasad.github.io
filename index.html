	<h1>Hi there, I'm Sujit Shivaprasad!</h1>
	<p><img src="img/me.png" alt="Sujit Shivaprasad" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10"/>	
	I love everything science, engineering, technology and finance. 
	Originally from Oregon, I have lived in India, Texas and Indiana. 
	<br>
	<br>
	Right now, I am a control systems engineer at Rolls Royce based out of Indianapolis, IN. In May 2017, I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Aeronautical & Astronautical Engineering from Purdue University.
	<br>
	<br>
	My primary technical interests are aerospace controls, dynamics, robotics and software engineering. 
	<br>
	<br>
	In my free time, I enjoy sports, hiking, travel, music and tasting a new brew.
