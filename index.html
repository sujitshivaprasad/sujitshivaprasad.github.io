	“The cosmos is within us. We are made of star-stuff. We are a way for the universe to know itself.” ― Carl Sagan	
	<br>
	<br>
	Originally from Oregon, I have lived in India, Texas, Indiana and Washington. 
	<br>
	<br>
	I am currently an engineer at Blue Origin working primarily on controls for fluid rocket subsystems.
	<br>
	<br>
	Previously, I worked at Boeing and Rolls Royce, working on environmental control systems and engine control systems respectively. In May 2017, I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Aeronautical & Astronautical Engineering from Purdue University.
	<br>
	<br>
	My primary technical interests include aerospace controls, modeling & simulation, systems and software engineering. 
	<br>
	<br>
	Some things I do in my free time include watching/playing sports, running, climbing, hiking, travel, live music and tasting a new brew. If you're interested in talking, contact me at sujit (dot) shivaprasad at the Google mail.
